DRUG DISCOVERY: PROTEIN AS DRUG TARGET 

INTRODUCTION

In drug discovery, a protein is considered a drug target when it plays an important role in the development or progression of a disease and can be modulated by a therapeutic agent (such as a small molecule, peptide, or antibody) to produce a desired therapeutic effect. Drug targets are typically proteins such as enzymes, receptors, ion channels, or transcription factors, whose activity or expression is directly linked to the disease pathology.

THE ROLE OF PROTEIN IN DISEASE PATHOLOGY

The vast majority of approved drugs are proteins. Knowledge of which proteins are the targets of approved drugs enables the proved drugs are proteins. Knowledge of which proteins are the targets of approved drugs enables the division of the human proteome into two classes: approved drug targets and non-targets.

In order for a protein to have any potential as a drug target it must be druggable. A druggable protein is one that possesses folds that favour interactions with small drug-like molecules, be they endogenous or extraneous, and therefore is one that contains a binding site (Russ, A. & Lampel, S. 2005).

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, proteins are very important target in cancer therapy. More research and development of protein targeted drugs hold promise for treating various cancers and improving patient outcomes.

Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of protein drug targets make them an important area of focus for future research and development.
